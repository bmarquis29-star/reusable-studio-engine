# System Charter
**Intent:** To create a responsive environment where human movement dictates the rhythm of geometry.

**Constraints:**
- Colors: Only grayscale (#050505 background, white stroke).
- Interaction: Single-point mouse tracking.
- Geometry: Pure circular forms only.

**Tensions:** Order vs. Chaos; Input vs. Autonomy.

**Taste Vow:** I refuse to use stock easing libraries or rainbow gradients.
