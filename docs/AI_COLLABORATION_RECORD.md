# AI Collaboration Record

## Project
- Repo: https://github.com/bmarquis29-star/proof-of-life-interactive 
- Deployed link (if applicable):
- Date started: Jan 29, 2026

## My constraints (before any AI)
- Intent (1 sentence): have a proof-of-life that is shown through a message in a bottle
- Constraints (3): dark, win or lose, answer-based format
- Tension (1): bottle moves, making it more interactive and hard to catch
- Taste vow (1): depicts the ocean

## Entry Log

### Entry 01 — (1/29/26)
**My next move (write before AI):** 
make it look less templated
Incorporate something unique
Use other ai’s to integrate other parts chatgpt couldn’t do

**Files touched:**
- index.html

**Copilot prompt (paste exact prompt):**
- Context: what you’re building and what the system is supposed to do
I'm building a proof-of-life interactive site where someone is lost and you find their message in a bottle and you have to answer questions to find their coordinates
Target: the one thing you want help with (one file, one function, one bug)
I need help making the water look more realistic
Constraints: what you refuse to add (no extra features, no new libraries, keep it readable, etc.)
Keeping it feel dark and ominous feeling
Acceptance test: how you will know it worked (what you expect to see on screen)
I expect to see the ocean waves look real, or at least move from something other than flat lines on the screen


**Copilot output (summarize in 3–6 bullets):**
- changed the template-like lines
- made the ocean look more like an ocean
- fixed what chatgpt couldn’t

**My translation (what changed and why):**
- the ocean waters changed, which was what chatgpt struggled with endlessly
- it still felt dark, but the waves looked as if you were in them looking beyond

**Signal / Noise:**
- Signal: the intent became clearer, it was almost hard to tell what I was going for on the original run
- Noise: it broke the constraints that the other ai couldn’t

**Next right action (one sentence):**
- change the emojis and other template feels, not just the waves

### Entry 02 — (2/17/26)

## Project
- Repo:https://github.com/bmarquis29-star/v3 
- Deployed link (if applicable):
- Date started: Feb 17, 2026

## My constraints (before any AI)
- Intent (1 sentence): make a game-like area in space using 3.js
- Constraints (3): dark, fun, endless
- Tension (1): the shift from v2 into v3
- Taste vow (1): an exploration-based game in space

## Entry Log

### Entry 01 — (2/17/26)
**My next move (write before AI):**
- change the atmosphere to be more expansive and informative
- realistic feel, not template-like feel

**Files touched:**
Docs
Index.html
script.js
process/screenshots
Screenshots
changelog.md

**Copilot prompt (paste exact prompt):**
- Context: what you’re building and what the system is supposed to do
		- a simple, 3D exploration game of space that is easy to navigate
Target: the one thing you want help with (one file, one function, one bug)
Fix the looks and aesthetic to become more realistic, of the planets
Constraints: what you refuse to add (no extra features, no new libraries, keep it readable, etc.)
More complexity, it needs to be a simple exploration game in 3D
Acceptance test: how you will know it worked (what you expect to see on screen)
I will see more detailed planets and comets and asteroids, maybe even an enhanced rocket


**Copilot output (summarize in 3–6 bullets):**
- fixed visuals
- improved what Gemini did
- made the atmosphere feel more space-like

**My translation (what changed and why):**
- more detail in almost everything, like the rocket and the asteroid belt because I prompted it to

**Signal / Noise:**
- Signal: the goal, it was simple and more detailed
- Noise: a lot is going on, but in a simple way, there’s just a lot to it

**Next right action (one sentence):**
- focus on new aspects that I can add into the game, for example: galaxy to galaxy travel or teleportation to each planet

Entry (03) (1/14/26)
## Project
- Repo:https://github.com/bmarquis29-star/HTML_game 
- Deployed link (if applicable):
- Date started: Jan 14, 2026

## My constraints (before any AI)
- Intent (1 sentence): simple game, like the floor is lava
- Constraints (3): blue, easy, slow-paced
- Tension (1): too easy to beat and has 3 platforms
- Taste vow (1): blue, and frog-like appeal

## Entry Log

### Entry 03 — (1/14/26)
**My next move (write before AI):**
- make it more detailed
- this was my first build, so I want to make it more designed

**Files touched:**
- index.html

**Copilot prompt (paste exact prompt):**
- Context: what you’re building and what the system is supposed to do
		- a simple game, based off of the floor is lava and everything’s blue
Target: the one thing you want help with (one file, one function, one bug)
Make it more like a frog you control that jumps the platforms and add more platforms
Constraints: what you refuse to add (no extra features, no new libraries, keep it readable, etc.)
Complexity, keep it simple, just have more design
Acceptance test: how you will know it worked (what you expect to see on screen)
I will see more platforms and detail


**Copilot output (summarize in 3–6 bullets):**
- added more platforms
- kept the blue
- worked quickly to fix the errors

**My translation (what changed and why):**
- added a frog-like character, added more lilypads/platforms because I had asked it to do so

**Signal / Noise:**
- Signal: it became more clear that this was based off a frog, not a blue block
- Noise: it broke the template barriers, but was still a little template-like

**Next right action (one sentence):**
- update the game to be something longer and fast-paced

still working on next few****
